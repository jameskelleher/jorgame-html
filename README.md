I'm teaching myself how to make a webapp! Most of the work is on the game itself, not the splash page.

To run:
1. Check out the repo
2. `cd` to the dir, run `npm install`
3. Run `node server.js`
4. Go to http://localhost:4000/ in your browser
5. Click the link that says "Join the public queue". Open another tab and repeat, once two clients are connected the game will start
