  <h3>How to play:</h3>
  <p>
    You and your opponent both have a deck of cards numbered 1-8. 
    Odd numbered cards are colored red, and even are green.
    Each round, you and your opponent will play a card, and whoever plays the higher card wins the round.
  </p>
  <p>
    The catch - you won't know what card your opponent played, only if its even or odd.
    Additionally, you will also know how many odd and even cards your opponent has left, but not what number they are.
    Use deduction and bluffing to win the game!
